The purpose of this website is to share my personal favorites in entertainment,
 specifically the manga One Piece and the music of artists Lil Uzi Vert and Playboi Carti. 
The site is designed to provide visitors with an introduction to my interests,
 a deeper look at my favorite story arcs and songs,
 and a way to contact me if they would like to share their own favorites or give feedback.
